                With the exception of the G310 series (which is produced at TVS's Tamil Nadu, India plant[4][5]), all BMW Motorrad's motorcycle production takes place at its plant in Berlin, Germany.[6] Some engines are manufactured in Austria, China, and Taiwan. Most of the current motorcycles in BMW Motorrad's range were designed by David Robb, who was the company's chief designer from 1993 to 2012 when he was replaced by Edgar Heinrich.[7][8][9]

The most popular model is the R1200GS and its sibling R1200GS Adventure, which sold 24,467 units â€“ accounting for 28% of BMW's annual production.[10] Current production includes a variety of shaft and chain driven models, with engines from 310 cc to 1,802 cc; and models designed for off-road, dual-purpose, sport, and touring activities.
